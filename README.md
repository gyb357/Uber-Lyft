#### Uber & Lyft Price Prediction


## Introduction

This repository contains all the necessary code and resources for analyzing, visualizing, and building machine learning models to predict ride prices for Uber and Lyft. The project focuses on extracting insights from the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and developing predictive models.




## Getting Started

## Clone and Install Librarires:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gyb357/Uber-Lyft.git
cd 'your repository directory'
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```




## Run codes

Once you've installed all the libraries, you can run main.py sequentially. Some commented code can be uncommented and run. 

The trained model can be tested in test.py.




## Contributions
This project was a collaborative effort among university teammates. Contributions included data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and presentation of results.
